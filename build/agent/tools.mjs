//  made and a try of it, and a look around the computer. Each tool only
//  PROPOSES: the build scene's logic decides —by fixed rules, asking the user
//  on a card when it has to—, does it, and answers. Every file goes through
//  it: it keeps the version before, checks what it asks the system for, and
//  answers with pleamar's verdict.
